# Airline delay problem

## Notebook reproduction

### Virtualenv
In my case I used VirtualenvWrapper, but you can use Pyenv or whichever your like.

```
mkvirtualenv airline
```

If you are using python 2.7 as default also you can do the following command to use python3.X in your virtualenv

```
mkvirtualenv $(which python3) airline
```

### Preparing the work environment

```
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

## Start notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```

Then go to your browser at **http://localhost:8888** . Inside the notebok folder you will find the solution notebook requested.
